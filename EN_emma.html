            <img src="./public/img/Portrait Emma WATSON.svg" alt="Portrait" class="portrait1">
            <p>Emma Watson, UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, is an important figure in feminism today. Her most important action is to have formalized the HeForShe campaign to fight for gender equality</p>
            <p class="titreArticle">Emma Watson, who is she ?</p>
            <p>Aged 31, Emma Watson is an actress who became famous playing the role of Hermione Granger in the iconic saga "Harry Potter" from 2001 to 2011, where she was nominated for many awards and won several.
                She also acted in many films such as the film adaptation of "Beauty and the Beast" where she played the lead role of "Belle" who for her is a feminist character fighting against discrimination from men.
                As a committed actress, she will be noticed during a feminist speech at the United Nations. Today, she is a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, where she will act for the fight of gender equality, but also in favor of fair trade and sustainable development.
                Emma Watson occupies an important place in the most profitable actresses of the decade from 2000 to 2009, in fact it is one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood with earnings estimated at 19 million pounds in February 2010.
            </p>
            <p class="titreArticle">HeForShe, A fight for gender equality</p>
            <p>To summarize, HeForShe is a solidarity campaign for gender equality. It was launched by the UN Women with the aim of involving men in the fight for gender equality and women's rights by encouraging them to take action against gender inequality.
                Emma Watson plays a major role in this movement, during a very poignant speech, it is she who officially announced in front of an assembly the launching of this campaign.</p>

            <img src="./public/img/Conférence HeForShe.svg" alt="Conférence" class="conference">
            <p>The audience, well aware of what she was saying, applauded repeatedly at the arguments she was making: "I am British and I think it is right that I should be paid as much as my male colleagues" she announced.
                After a long and heavy build-up of similar arguments, she ended her speech with a cold note to make her audience think: "Unfortunately, there is not a single country in the world in which all women can expect to receive all these rights."</p>
            <p class="titreArticle">Feminist but cool</p>
            <p>When we hear the term feminist, we immediately think that the person is not fun at all. 
                "However, Emma Watson since the beginning of her fight in feminism, has influenced many women who did not dare to consider themselves as such.
                Thanks to her, many of them know that a woman can be a feminist, but also be feminine, kind, vulnerable, delicate and ask to be taken seriously.
                During her interview for the HeForShe campaign, the actress addressed women by saying; "I invite you introverted feminists to come out of the shadows and ask yourselves: if not you, who will act? If not now, when will we drive change?"</p>
